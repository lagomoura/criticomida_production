# Project Status

## Phase 1: Foundation - Modern Frontend & Basic Structure
- [x] **Choose a JavaScript Framework**: This is crucial for building an interactive and manageable user interface.
  - [x] React (with Next.js): Extremely popular, vast ecosystem, great for SEO and performance with Next.js (which offers server-side rendering and static site generation). Component-based architecture makes UI development modular.
  - [~] Vue.js (with Nuxt.js): Known for its easier learning curve compared to React, also excellent for SEO and performance with Nuxt.js. Also component-based.
  - [~] Svelte (with SvelteKit): A newer entrant that compiles to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript. SvelteKit is its accompanying application framework.
- [x] **Recommendation**:
    - [~] If you're new to frameworks, Vue.js might be more approachable.
    - [x] If you're looking for the largest community and job market, React is a strong choice.
- [x] **Component-Based Design**: Break down your UI into reusable components (e.g., Navbar, RestaurantCard, ReviewForm, Footer, SearchBar). Your current index.html sections (about, reviews, services) would become components.
    - [x] Navbar
    - [x] Banner
    - [x] AboutSection
    - [x] ReviewsSection
    - [x] ServicesSection
    - [x] Footer
- [x] **Routing**: Implement client-side routing (e.g., using React Router for React, Vue Router for Vue) to navigate between different "pages" like the homepage, individual restaurant detail pages, user profiles, etc., without full page reloads.
    - [x] / (Home)
    - [x] /restaurants (Restaurants List)
    - [x] /restaurants/[id] (Restaurant Detail)
    - [x] /profile (User Profile)
- [x] **Styling**:
  - [x] Bootstrap: You're already using it. You can continue to leverage its grid system and pre-styled components, perhaps in conjunction with Tailwind CSS or custom styles.
  - [ ] Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and highly customizable designs. It pairs well with component-based frameworks.
  - [ ] CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components, Emotion for React): If you prefer to write CSS directly within your JavaScript components.
- [x] **FontAwesome Integration**: All required icons are now properly registered, FontAwesome CSS is loaded, and the icon library is configured for Next.js app directory. All icons render correctly in the UI.

## Phase 2: Backend & Database - Making it Dynamic
- [ ] To store restaurant information, reviews, user accounts, etc., you'll need a backend and database.
- [ ] **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) - Quickest to get "live"**:
  - [ ] Supabase: An excellent open-source Firebase alternative. It provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities with a generous free tier. You can interact with it directly from your frontend JavaScript.
  - [ ] Firebase (Google): Another popular BaaS solution offering Firestore (NoSQL database), authentication, hosting, etc.
- [ ] **Recommendation**: 
    - [ ] Supabase is a strong contender for its use of PostgreSQL and open-source nature.
- [ ] **Custom Backend - More Control & Flexibility**:
  - [ ] Node.js with Express.js: If you're comfortable with JavaScript, this is a natural fit. You can build RESTful APIs to serve data to your frontend.
  - [ ] Python with Django or Flask: Robust and widely-used Python frameworks for web development.
- [ ] **Database for Custom Backend**:
  - [ ] PostgreSQL: Powerful, open-source relational database.
  - [ ] MongoDB: Popular NoSQL document database, often used with Node.js.
- [ ] **API Design**: Design clear API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data (e.g., GET /restaurants, POST /restaurants/:id/reviews).

## Phase 3: Core Features for a Food Review Site
- [x] **Restaurant Listings & Details**:
  - [x] Display a list of restaurants (currently using mock data for all categories, with a polished, animated, and interactive gallery grid for each category. WOW effect implemented.)
  - [ ] Each restaurant should have its own page showing details (address, cuisine type, photos, map integration).
  - [ ] Display average ratings.
  - [x] Restaurant cards are now clickable (desserts category) and link to a modern detail page.
  - [x] Modern restaurant detail page for dessert restaurants: includes summary with pros/cons, diary/note space, and a gallery of tasted foods (photo, date, text, pros/cons for each plate) with fallback images. (Other categories coming soon.)
- [ ] **Review System**:
  - [ ] Allow users to submit reviews (text, star rating, potentially photos).
  - [ ] Display reviews on restaurant detail pages.
- [ ] **User Authentication**:
  - [ ] User sign-up, login, and logout.
  - [ ] User profiles where they can see their past reviews.
- [ ] **Search & Filtering**:
  - [ ] Search restaurants by name, cuisine, location.
  - [ ] Filter restaurants by rating, etc.
  - [x] Reviews category page now features advanced, space-efficient, animated filters: multi-select for locations and tags, dual-range sliders for rating, review count range, active filter chips, and a clear-all button. Major UI/UX milestone.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] **Admin Panel/Dashboard**: A secure area for you (the admin) to manage restaurant listings, moderate reviews, and manage users.
- [ ] **Image Uploads**: For restaurant photos and user review photos.
- [ ] **Map Integration**: Show restaurant locations on a map (e.g., using Leaflet.js, Google Maps API, or Mapbox).
- [ ] **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share reviews or restaurant pages.
- [ ] **SEO Optimization**: Crucial for a review site. Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js help significantly here.
- [x] **Improved UI/UX**: Restaurant gallery and cards now feature a clean, modern, animated, and visually appealing design with advanced hover and entrance effects (WOW effect). Fully responsive and accessible.
- [x] Advanced, animated filter system for reviews category page implemented (multi-select, range sliders, chips, clear-all, responsive grid).

## Phase 5: Deployment - Going Live
- [ ] **Frontend & BaaS**:
  - [ ] Vercel (by the creators of Next.js): Excellent for deploying Next.js apps, React projects, and other frontend frameworks. Integrates well with serverless functions.
  - [ ] Netlify: Similar to Vercel, great for static sites, JAMstack sites, and frontend frameworks. Offers serverless functions and form handling.
- [ ] **Full-Stack Applications (Custom Backend)**:
  - [ ] Render.com: A modern cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy web apps, databases, and backend services.
  - [ ] Heroku: A long-standing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that simplifies deployment.
  - [ ] AWS, Google Cloud, Azure: Offer more comprehensive cloud services if you need more control or scale, but have a steeper learning curve.

## Recommendations Based on Your Current Project:
- [ ] Since your current project is a single HTML page, moving to a dynamic, feature-rich application will essentially be a rewrite.
- [ ] **If you want to get something "live" quickly with dynamic data**:
  - [ ] Choose a BaaS like Supabase.
  - [ ] Keep your current HTML/CSS structure for now.
  - [ ] Modify your JavaScript (js/app.js) to fetch restaurant and review data from Supabase and dynamically render it into your HTML. This avoids an immediate full framework rewrite but gets you dynamic content.
  - [ ] Create a simple, private way for you to add data to Supabase.
- [ ] **For the long-term, robust solution (the food critic site you envision)**:
  - [ ] I strongly recommend committing to learning a frontend framework (React with Next.js or Vue with Nuxt.js) and a backend solution (either Supabase for ease or Node.js/Express for a custom backend). This is the path to a truly scalable and modern web application.

## Key Considerations:
- [ ] **Learning Curve**: Adopting new frameworks and backend technologies takes time. Be patient and break down the learning process.
- [ ] **Effort**: This is a substantial project. Start with the core features and iterate.
- [ ] **User Experience (UX)**: Constantly think about how users will interact with your site. Make it easy to find information and submit reviews.
